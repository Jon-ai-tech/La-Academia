# üéØ La Academia Maia Kode - Locomotive Style

## Quick Start

### Development
```bash
npm run preview    # Start development server
npm run build     # Build SCSS and process assets  
npm run dev       # Watch files and auto-rebuild (with BrowserSync)
```

## ‚ú® Features Implemented

### Locomotive-Style Effects
- **3D Floating Animations**: Advanced geometric shapes with Aurora Dorada colors
- **Particle System**: Dynamic particles with mouse/scroll interactions  
- **Custom Cursor**: Enhanced cursor with velocity-based effects and trails
- **Scroll Animations**: Parallax effects and appear animations
- **Interactive Effects**: Ripple clicks, gradient glows, particle bursts

### Build System
- **Gulp**: Automated SASS compilation and asset processing
- **BrowserSync**: Live reload during development
- **SASS**: Organized stylesheets with modular architecture

### Colors (Aurora Dorada)
- `#FFC777` - Dorado Vibrante (Gold)
- `#58A6FF` - Azul El√©ctrico (Electric Blue)
